# Module-7-Challenge

## Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to provide Pewlett Hackard (PH) with the required information regarding future retirements. This information is crucial for the long term success of the company and will help guide PH with decisions surrounding recruitment, training and mentorship programs.

## Results: 
Summary: In response to the upcoming "silver tsunami", 300,024 roles have been identified as key roles for which PH needs to actively backfill as shown in the table below:

## Summary
The potential number of current employees at PH that have been identified as available for mentorship totals only 1,940.
Given the volume of future retirees, PH will need to look at actively recruiting and training individuals from outside the company, and this work needs to start as soon as possible!
